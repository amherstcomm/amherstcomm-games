                      No — every daily here is ours, generated on our own server, so

                      They&apos;re three separate puzzles each day, not one puzzle with a
                      setting — each difficulty keeps its own progress, statistics,
                      streaks and leaderboards, and you can play all three. What changes
                      depends on the game: Guess, Scramble, Hive and Boxed draw their
                      answers from progressively less common words; Squares and Weave
                      grow their boards; Grid keeps its dice and widens what scores.

                    <p>
                      Each difficulty is scored against its own word list — Easy is
                      everyday English, Hard adds the less common words, Extreme takes
                      nearly everything. What a puzzle <em>accepts</em> is deliberately
                      one size more generous than the list its <em>answers</em> come
                      from, so the answer is always something you might recognise while
                      your long shots get the benefit of the doubt.

                      The lists are built from open dictionaries (SCOWL and friends —
                      see Legal for credits), lowercase letters only: no proper nouns,
                      no hyphens or apostrophes, no accents. Nothing is checked against
                      any publisher&apos;s list, so our Hive and the NYT&apos;s bee will
                      disagree at the margins. If a real word is missing, report it —
                      the lists do get amended.

                      From what we publish, yes: no puzzle will hand you a slur as its
                      answer. From what you type, no — refusing to publish a word and
                      refusing to accept one you played are different things, and only
                      the first is ours to decide.

                      You already have one. Reaching this site at all means signing in
                      with your Amherst account, and the site signs you in again behind
                      the scenes so your statistics <em>and</em> today&apos;s unfinished
                      puzzles follow you between devices — start on a phone, finish on a
                      laptop, and a daily you have already played won&apos;t come back as
                      a fresh board somewhere else. There is no separate password to
                      remember and nothing to create.

                      On a server inside the company, and in your browser. The letters
                      you type are checked where you type them and never leave your
                      device — only the result does, once you finish. Your completed
