// Where the app is, and the two effects that keep the address bar honest.
//
// Everything here used to sit in the middle of App.tsx: nine `useState`s, a
// priority ladder, three refs, a thirty-line effect and a seventeen-setter
// reducer, interleaved with word lists and solver state. Extracting it is the
// point of the exercise — not because the file was long, but because this is
// where the troubleshooting kept landing, and because none of it could be
// reached from a test without rendering the whole application.
//
// What stays in App: `mode`, `learnMode`, the ten play flags and `dailyByMode`.
// `mode` alone is read at ninety-odd sites and persisted; moving it would drag
// half the file with it. So the split is *page and overlay identity* here,
// *which game and which view* there.
//
// Two hooks rather than one, and the reason is ordering rather than taste. The
// nav state has to exist early — modal focus handling reads it a thousand lines
// before `currentView` and `dailyByMode` are computed — while the address is
// not knowable until those exist. One hook would have to be called twice or
// take a ref and lie about its dependencies. Two hooks say the truth: the state
// is one thing, the browser is another, and the address joins them.
