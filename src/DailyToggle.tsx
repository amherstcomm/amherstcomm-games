// Daily or practice — the third rung of the control ladder.
//
// Every game climbs the same ladder (see CLAUDE.md): surface, then what the
// board is built from, then *which board*, then the game. This is that third
// rung, and until now it was written out inside each game that had it. Six
// carried an identical copy; Squares and Cryptogram carry variants with their
// own extra controls in the same row; Ladder offered a grey text link below
// the board instead, and Bridge had nothing at all — its practice mode could
// not be reached by any control on the page.
//
// So this exists to be the rung rather than to save lines. A game either shows
// it or has no practice; there is no third option, and a text link below the
// board is not the same control in a different coat — it is a different answer
// to "which board am I playing".
//
// Hidden rather than disabled when practice is switched off in Settings: the
// choice is not merely unavailable, it does not exist, and a greyed pill
// invites you to work out why.
