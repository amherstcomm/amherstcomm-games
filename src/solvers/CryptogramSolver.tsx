// The Cryptogram solver: a passage in, what the word shapes force out.
//
// Deduce, then offer. This never picks a reading: it settles what the shapes
// force and hands back the choices for what they don't, because a passage can
// have several readings where every word is real and only a person can tell
// which one means anything.
//
// Fourth solver surface out of App.tsx, and the cleanest cut of the four —
// none of its state is persisted, so unlike Bridge, Ladder and Squares there is
// no pair of strings left behind on App's save timer. The whole machine moves:
// the text, the picks, the index, the analysis and the hunches.
//
// Two guards disappeared in the move rather than being copied. Both read
// `mode !== 'cryptogram' || cryptogramPlay` and returned null, because a memo
// inside App runs on every render of every game. A component that only mounts
// on this surface does not need to ask.
//
// The rules live in @/cryptogramSolver, which the play surface imports too.
