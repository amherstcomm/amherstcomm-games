// The two lists in Settings that decide which games you can choose.
//
// Both were typed out and both stopped at eight, so Ladder and Bridge could be
// neither set as a start page nor hidden from the nav — the games were
// playable, had dailies and leaderboards, and were absent from the only screen
// that offers to show or hide them. Nothing failed, because a list that is
// short renders perfectly.
//
// Worse, the "don't hide your last game" guard compares against the length of
// that same list, so it was counting to eight: hiding eight of ten games would
// have refused the eighth while two remained.
